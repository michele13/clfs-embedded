  <title>Supported Devices for WRT</title>

  <para>In order to build CLFS for your device, we need to know what processor
  it has, if it is big or little endian, and what MIPS ISA level it is. The 
  MIPS ISA level is needed so that we can build uClibc properly. </para>

  <para>The following is a list of devices that have been tested and reported 
  as tested and working with this book. Apart from this list, there is no 
  guarantee that your device, will work. If you are successful in getting a
  device to work, please contact the CLFS development team, and we will add 
  it to the list. For the most recent and up to date list, please view the 
  GIT version of this book. </para>
