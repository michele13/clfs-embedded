  <title>Creating a Build Directory</title>

  <para> Create a directory for the CLFS build (the exact location is up to
    you): </para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -p /mnt/clfs</userinput></screen>

  <para>Assign it to the <envar>CLFS</envar> environment variable:</para>

<screen><userinput>export CLFS=/mnt/clfs</userinput></screen>

  <para>Ensure that this new directory has permissions that are too restrictive
    such that you can write to it as a non-root user.</para>

<screen><userinput>chmod 777 $CLFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Now that there is an established place to work, it is time to
  download the packages.</para>
