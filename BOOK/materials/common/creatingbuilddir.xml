  <title>Creating Build and Sources Directories</title>

  <para> Create a directory for the CLFS build.  The exact location is up to you
    but depending on the location you choose, you may need to do this as the
    root user: </para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -p /mnt/clfs</userinput></screen>

  <para>Assign it to the <envar>CLFS</envar> environment variable:</para>

<screen><userinput>export CLFS=/mnt/clfs</userinput></screen>

  <para>Ensure that this new directory has permissions that are not too
    restrictive such that you can write to it as a non-root user.  Depending on
    the location of the <envar>CLFS</envar> directory, you may need to do this
    as the root user:</para>

<screen><userinput>chmod 777 ${CLFS}</userinput></screen>

  <para>Downloaded packages and patches will need to be stored somewhere
  that is conveniently available throughout the entire build. A working
  directory is also required to unpack the sources and build them.
  <filename class="directory">${CLFS}/sources</filename> can be used both
  as the place to store the tarballs and patches and as a working
  directory.</para>

  <para>Create a directory to store the sources:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -v ${CLFS}/sources</userinput></screen>
