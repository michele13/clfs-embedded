  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter creates a directory where the cross compiler toolchain wil
  be built and a directory where sources are kept.  It includes a list of
  packages that need to be downloaded for building a basic Linux
  system.</para>

  <para>The listed version numbers correspond to versions of the software that
  are known to work, and this book is based on their use. We highly recommend
  not using newer or older versions because the build commands for one version may not
  work with another version.</para>

  <para>Download locations may not always be accessible. If a download
  location has changed since this book was published, Google (<ulink
  url="http://www.google.com/"/>) provides a useful search engine for
  most packages.</para>
