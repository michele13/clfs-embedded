  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para os="a">In this chapter, we enter the building site and start
  constructing the CLFS system in earnest. The installation of this
  software is straightforward. Although in many cases the installation
  instructions could be made shorter and more generic, we have opted
  to provide the full instructions for every package to minimize the
  possibilities for mistakes.  The key to learning what makes a Linux
  system work is to know what each package is used for and why the user
  (or the system) needs it.  For every installed package, a summary of
  its contents is given, followed by concise descriptions of each
  program and library the package installed.</para>

  <para os="b">The order that packages are installed in this chapter needs to
  be strictly followed to ensure that no program accidentally acquires a
  path referring to <filename class="directory">${CLFS}/cross-tools</filename>
  hard-wired into it. For the same reason, do not compile packages in
  parallel. Compiling in parallel may save time (especially on dual-CPU
  machines), but it could result in a program containing a hard-wired
  path to <filename class="directory">${CLFS}/cross-tools</filename>, which will
  cause the program to stop working when that directory is
  removed.</para>
