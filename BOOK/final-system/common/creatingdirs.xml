  <title>Creating Directories</title>

  <para>It is time to create some structure in the target CLFS file system.
  Create a standard directory tree by issuing the following commands:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv ${CLFS}/targetfs/{bin,boot,dev,etc,home,lib/{firmware,modules}}
mkdir -pv ${CLFS}/targetfs/{mnt,opt,proc,sbin,srv,sys}
mkdir -pv ${CLFS}/targetfs/var/{cache,lib,local,lock,log,opt,run,spool}
install -dv -m 0750 ${CLFS}/targetfs/root
install -dv -m 1777 ${CLFS}/targetfs/{var/,}tmp
mkdir -pv ${CLFS}/targetfs/usr/{,local/}{bin,include,lib,sbin,share,src}</userinput></screen>

  <para>Directories are, by default, created with permission mode 755, but
  this is not desirable for all directories. In the commands above, two
  changes are made&mdash;one to the home directory of user <systemitem
  class="username">root</systemitem>, and another to the directories for
  temporary files.</para>

  <para>The first mode change ensures that not just anybody can enter
  the <filename class="directory">/root</filename> directory&mdash;the
  same as a normal user would do with his or her home directory. The
  second mode change makes sure that any user can write to the
  <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> and <filename
  class="directory">/var/tmp</filename> directories, but cannot remove
  another user's files from them. The latter is prohibited by the so-called
  <quote>sticky bit,</quote> the highest bit (1) in the 1777 bit mask.</para>

    <title>FHS Compliance Note</title>

    <para>The directory tree is based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
    (available at <ulink url="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml"/>).</para>
