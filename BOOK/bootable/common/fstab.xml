  <title>Creating the /etc/fstab File</title>

  <indexterm zone="ch-bootable-fstab">

  </indexterm>

  <para os="a">The <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file is used by some
  programs to determine where file systems are to be mounted by default,
  in which order, and which must be checked (for integrity errors) prior
  to mounting.  For our embedded system, the bootloader will tell Linux where to
  find the root file system and we will not mount any additional file systems,
  so we can create an empty file system table like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; ${CLFS}/targetfs/etc/fstab &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal># file-system  mount-point  type   options          dump  fsck</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>You may add any other file systems, such as swap or other partitions
  or network file systems, to this fstab if you wish.</para>
