  <title>Copy to Target</title>

  <para>We just created a cleaned-up version of our build, now
  we can compress it so we can move it to our target.</para>

  <para>Let's Create A tarball of our build:</para>

<screen><userinput>install -dv ${CLFS}/build
cd ${CLFS}-final
tar jcfv ${CLFS}/build/clfs-embedded.tar.bz2 *
</userinput></screen>

  <para>Now you can move your compressed tarball to your target
  system. This is something that is going to be different on
  every embedded device.</para>
