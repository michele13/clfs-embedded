Cross Linux From Scratch Embedded
=================================

Cross Linux From Scratch (CLFS) Embedded shows you how to build a Linux system
from source, targeting users who want to make a very small system.

Running with 16 MB of RAM and 16 MB of "disk" is very possible.

For more information about CLFS, visit the [CLFS website][trac].

To build the book, please see the BOOK/INSTALL.md file for requirements and
exact steps.
